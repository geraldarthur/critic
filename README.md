I love to watch movies. Some weekends I'll rip through four or more of them back-to-back.

Long before I coded or even read Infinite Jest, I had this crazy dream that I'd study physics and write movies. My very first script was an inadvertent rip-off of Annie Hall; I hadn't even seen the movie, but I was a neurotic kid in middle and high school.

I began to rate movies religiously on Netflix to find my next new favorite.

After a while I realized there were only so many movies in their library that I could watch. Rather than letting all that data go to waste, I'm going to make an app (or attempt to).

**ROADMAP:** 
* Template out a page
* Get some stats on my ratings
* Form validation and...oh god what am I getting into?!
