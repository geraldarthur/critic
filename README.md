I love to watch movies. Some weekends I'll rip through four or more of them back-to-back.

Long before I even read Infinite Jest, I had this crazy dream that I'd study physics and write movies. My very first script was an inadvertent rip-off of Annie Hall; I hadn't even seen the movie, but I was a neurotic kid in middle and high school.

I began to rate movies religiously, pouring over Netflix's library to see what I could plug in and what it would return as movies it thought I'd like.

Well
